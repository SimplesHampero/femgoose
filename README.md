## Installation

To install the application, firstly you'll want to install the project's dependancies from npm.

`npm install`

You'll then want to setup the applications configuration. You'll find two files in the config folder

`config/~config.development.js`
`config/~config.production.js`

You'll want to either rename these files, removing the initial '~' character, or create new ones with the following names:

`config/config.development.js`
`config/config.production.js`
